I'm currently a college student at New Jersey Institute of Technology majoring in Computer Science! I am a Full-Stack web-dev and mainly have developed in the MERN stack. I have done some work in AI/ML, cryptocurrency smart contracts, and even assembly.

Currently really interested in the Metaverse and am a Avatar/World Creator for Unity based metaverses.
